# ElectronicPiano
An electronic Piano utilizes eight Wien-bridge oscillator circuits, a summing module, an audio amplification module, and a speaker. Each one of the eight Wien-bridge oscillators produce one of the following notes and frequencies: D (1175 [Hz]), E (1319 [Hz]), F# (1480 [Hz]), G (1568 [Hz]), A (1760 [Hz]), B (1976 [Hz]), C# (2218 [Hz]), and D (2349 [Hz]). The summing network combines the keys outputs and mixes the different frequencies if the user pressed the Piano keys simultaneously. The output of this summer Module feeds the audio amplification stage which has a 10 [kΩ] trimpot voltage-divider for volume control. The circuit produces all the frequencies per the specifications with an average frequency error of 1.56 %. The maximum output power is 1.3 [W] delivered to an 8 [Ω] speaker with maximum output current of 410 [mA]. Our low, budget beginner pianist can use this device to enjoy an affordable Piano lessons training with an instrument that can be built from used parts found in old, retired electronic devices. Of course, our team is planning to release the devices schematics and specification to the public domain, free of charge.
